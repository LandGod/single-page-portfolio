function ProjectCard(props) {
  // PROPS:
  //   width?: "single" or "double" - Makes the component 4 or 8 columns in medium view - Default = single
  //   imageName: file name of image to be displayed
  //   title: Name of project/title
  //   repoLink?: link to project repo
  //   deployLink?: link to deployed project
  //   highlight: number - 0: tech missing; 1: no techs selected; 2: has all selected techs
  //   summary: Short summary of the project
  //   displayTitle?: boolean - set to true if the title needs to be displayed as text on top of the image overlay (not already in the image) - default true

  // CONTEXT - This component consumes the MediaContext provider in order to be mobile responsive using the smBreakPoint property

  // STATE & EFFECT:
  //   State and effct here are used exclusively for the purpose of showing/hiding the title image overlay. The overlay should be hidden whenever the card is hovered over or in any way
  //   gains focus. This reveals a description of the project and links to the deployed website and/or repo.
  // The focus tracking modle here has two parts:
  //   1. One is a state variable that tracks whether or not the element should behave as if it has focus. This is the detailVisible variable.
  //   2. Our modle is two seperate state variables to track whether or not a focus-giving or focus losing event has occured. These are the mouseOver & blured state variables.
  // Using this modle helps us avoid 2 key pitfalls:
  //   1. On devices that can't hover, clicking on the element gives it a hover state so quickly that the mouse can actually click "through" the overlay to the underlying button
  //     without the use having seen it first. This is undesireable and super confusing to users. They should only be able to click buttons they can see. By seperating getting focus
  //     and hiding the overlay into seperate concerns, we can hide the overlay with a useEffect function, allowing the underlying buttons to be clicked only after they are revealed.
  //   2. On IE/Edge, the css pseudoselector focus-within is not available. This means that tabselecting to an inner button of a project card, can cause the entire card to lose focus
  //     before React realizes that a child is focused. This then causes the child buttons to lose focus anway, since they get hidden. Obviously this not what we want.

  // State variables
  const [mouseOver, setMouseOver] = useState(false); // Tracks wether or not the component has just recieved focus and/or mouse enter event
  const [detailVisible, setDetailVisible] = useState(false); // Tracks whether or not the project info and buttons should be visible (ie: overlay title/image is invisible)
  const [blured, setBlured] = useState(false); // Tracks whether or not any blur event has just occured on the card so that we can trigger our useEffect for blur handling

  // Reference to highest level element in component, used for tracking if any part of the component has focus using DOM method
  const thisCard = createRef();

  // Called by onMouseEnter & onFocus. Does nothing if card is "greyed out" by technology filters.
  const mouseOnComponent = () => {
    if (props.highlight) {
      setMouseOver(true);
    }
  };

  // Called by onMouseLeave & onBlur
  const handleBlur = () => {
    setBlured(true);
  };

  // Explained above. Mediates visibiliy of overlay, since using raw focus/blur leads to issues.
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check for recent blur event
    if (blured) {
      // Blur events require a double check using this DOM method, since they are triggered even when focus is lost to an own child
      if (!(document.activeElement === thisCard)) {
        setDetailVisible(false);
      }
      return () => {
        setBlured(false);
      };
    }
    // If there was not a recent blur event, check for a recent mouseEnter/Hover event
    else if (mouseOver) {
      // This doesn't need to be double-checked with the DOM and doing so seems to introduce errors, so we don't.
      setDetailVisible(true);
      return () => {
        setMouseOver(false);
      };
    }

    // Because Blured & MouseOver are only meant to be true if a related event was just triggered, they are always reset to false after being read.
    return () => {
