### High Priority
* Swap in most recent resume pdf
* Add twitter button

### Fixes:
* Change project card overlay from overflow:scroll to overflow:auto (to hide scrollbar when not needed)
* Go back to scroll event listener and add `{once: true}` as second argument.

### Nice to have
* Animated arrows prompting the user to scroll down from the about section, if they don't, after 3 seconds or so
* Make social/contact buttons look less like ass
* Make project images look less like ass
* Optimize all images for efficiency 
* Update readme?
* Make technology icons look nicer and more consistent?
* Open resume in new tab?
