### High Priority
* Lots of broken styling on MS Edge.

### Fixes:
* Make project images look less like ass
* Optimize all images for efficiency

### Nice to have
* Animated arrows prompting the user to scroll down from the about section, if they don't, after 3 seconds or so
* Update readme?
* Make technology icons look nicer and more consistent?
* Custom favicon
* Revisit mobile styling for project cards?
* Normalize z-index values

### Accessibility 
* Make site totally navigable with keyboard
