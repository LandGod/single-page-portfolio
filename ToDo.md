### High Priority
* 

### Fixes:
* Add focus-within pseudoselector to project card overlay to keep it from flickering when tabbing to buttons (on browsers that support it)
* Fix needing to double click on project card buttons to open links, on mobile.

### Nice to haves:
* Animated arrows prompting the user to scroll down from the about section, if they don't, after 3 seconds or so
* Update readme?
* Make technology icons look nicer and more consistent?
* Normalize z-index values

### In Progress:
* Make new nicer project images
